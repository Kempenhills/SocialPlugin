# Social Sharing

<a href="http://www.kempenhills.nl">![KempenHills ICT B.V. Logo](http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/41641793/5ecd217ad2bec9299b198ff39a95b463.png?size=200)</a>

The Social Sharing plugin makes your life a lot easier when it comes to interacting with either Facebook or Twitter from a Cordova app!
With this plugin it is fairly simple to authenticate and post to Facebook and Twitter. It focuses on the Single Sign On techniques both the Facebook and Twitter SDK use. 

When a user hasn't logged in to his Native Facebook settings or uses iOS5.x the Facebook SDK falls back to the old style. This means there will be dialogs instead of the Facebookpanel and app-switching when logging in and or posting.

If a user has not logged in to Twitter yet via settings, an alertView is presented to the user, asking whether the user wants to log in or not.

Feel free to improve or upgrade the plugin!

## How to use
First we must include all the files to our project.

1. ### Javascript
	* Copy the www/js/ folder into your project.
	* Include the khsocialplugin.js in your html header file


2. ### Android
	* Copy the content of native/Android/ into your project's src folder.
	* Add the following in res/xml/plugins.xml or res/xml/config.xml (depends on Cordova version):
```
<plugin name="Social" value="com.kempenhills.SocialPlugin"/>
```
	*Note: Android only supports the presentActionSheet action (Intent.ACTION_SEND).

3. ### iOS
	* Copy the content of native/ios/ into your project's plugins group.
	* Add the mapping 'KHSocialPlugin' -> 'KHSocialPlugin' to cordova.plist
    * Add Twitter.framework to your project's frameworks in Target -> Build Phases -> Link binary with library
	* Include the Facebook SDK **AND** Deprecated header. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/getting-started/facebook-sdk-for-ios/3.1/">Facebook iOS SDK tutorial</a> <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/howtos/feed-dialog-using-ios-sdk/">Step 2. 'Backwards compatability'</a><br />
	* Replace the last part of the AppDelegate.m's application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions with the following:
    
```objc
self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController;
[self.window makeKeyAndVisible];

[(KHSocialPlugin*)[self.viewController getCommandInstance:@"KHSocialPlugin"] application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];

return YES;
```
 
* Add the following block to the AppDelegate.m
    

```objc
-(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
        KHSocialPlugin* khsp = [self.viewController getCommandInstance:@"KHSocialPlugin"];
    return [khsp application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
}

-(void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application; {
    KHSocialPlugin* khsp = [self.viewController getCommandInstance:@"KHSocialPlugin"];
    [khsp applicationDidBecomeActive:application];
}
```

* Thats all for iOS, Happy sharing!

**The javascript calls are easy to learn. Check out the example project for further reference!**

```javascript

navigator.camera.getPicture(function(imgURI){
        window.plugins.KHSocialPlugin.FBPostToUserTimeline('Check out the brand new KempenHills ICT B.V. Social Plugin! Using local images!', imgURI,'https://github.com/Kempenhills/SocialPlugin');
    }, function(e){}, {
        quality:            40,
        destinationType:    Camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI,
        sourceType :        Camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY,
        correctOrientation: true
    });

```
