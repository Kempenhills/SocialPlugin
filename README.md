The Social Sharing plugin makes your life a lot easier when it comes to interacting with either Facebook or Twitter from a Cordova app!

## How to use
First we must include all the right files to our project.
1. Javascript
	* Copy the www/js/ folder into your project.
	* Include the khsocialplugin.js in your html header file

2. iOS
	* Copy the content of native/ios/ into your project's plugins group
	* Add the mapping 'KHSocialPlugin' -> 'KHSocialPlugin' to cordova.plist
	* Include the Facebook SDK **AND** Deprecated header. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/getting-started/facebook-sdk-for-ios/3.1/">Facebook iOS SDK tutorial</a> <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/howtos/feed-dialog-using-ios-sdk/">Step 2. 'Backwards compatability'</a><br />
	* Add <code>
    [(KHSocialPlugin*)[self.viewController getCommandInstance:@"KHSocialPlugin"]
<br />application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
</code> to the bottom of your AppDelegate.m's applicationDidFinishLaunching:withOptions method, right above the return YES; statement
	* Add the following block to the AppDelegate.m 
    

``` 

-(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
        KHSocialPlugin* khsp = [self.viewController getCommandInstance:@"KHSocialPlugin"];
    return [khsp application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
}

-(void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application; {
    KHSocialPlugin* khsp = [self.viewController getCommandInstance:@"KHSocialPlugin"];
    [khsp applicationDidBecomeActive:application];
}
```
    * Add Twitter.framework to your project's frameworks in Target -> Build Phases -> Link binary with library
    * Take a look at the example project if you think you did something wrong
